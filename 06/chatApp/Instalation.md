```bash
expo init "name of the app"
```

### Install the navigation

```bash
npm add @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack react-native-gifted-chat
```

### Install the other dependencies (firebase, dotenv, screens, gesture handler...)

```bash
expo install firebase expo-constants dotenv react-native-gesture-handler react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
```
