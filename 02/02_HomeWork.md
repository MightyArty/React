## In this week we will start our project

> So, after we refreshed our memory with all the information that we need, we will build step-by-step the MID semester project.

> In the class, I've showed some page content that I would like you to follow

1. Make a React program, that show some dynamic text box with a button
2. Allow the user to enter some `string` in this box
3. After that, show the entered `string` on the screen
4. Every component and element should be designed with CSS
5. Use the `SOC` method (Seperation of Concern): each component must be in his own file, and have his own css file.
6. Take a look at (5) again, VERY IMPORTANT AND WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT PART OF YOUR GRADE!
