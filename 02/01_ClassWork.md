## A (Just for refreshing)

1. Create a new file `PersonDetails.js` - class component.
2. In the constructor - define the props & state.
   - props: get the country, city and street address.
   - state: name, age, profession
3. Show all the details in a HTML table.
4. Add some styles using CSS:
   - edit the table so the look would be more nice
   - add styling to the button
   - add some functionality to the button (maybe will pop up a message or whatever...)
